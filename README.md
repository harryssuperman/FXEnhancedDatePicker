# FXEnhancedDatePicker
It is an enhanced Datepicker for the JavaFX.

The currente JavaFX Datepicker is really nice but if you have to set years or months then you should write the date with the Keyboard or clicking/scrolling one by one in the fields for that.
With **FXEnhancedDatePicker**, I want to improve the selection for the years/months showing an extra panel when we make doubleclick.
This extra Panel will show the next years for a decade or a group of decades, making possible setting Dates just with a few clicks
